# Welcome to the HWO-GOMAP Working Groups GitHub

The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) is NASA's first astrophysics flagship mission concept to enter the Great Observatory Maturation Program (GOMAP). Two groups will guide the GOMAP activities for HWO: the Science, Technology, Architecture Review Team (START) and the Technical Assessment Group (TAG). Community Working Groups (WG) and Sub-Groups (SG) have been organized along the START and TAG to conduct GOMAP activities for HWO over the coming year. For more information, see the [NASA GOMAP-HWO website](https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/programs/habitable-worlds-observatory/). 

This GitHub Organization serves as the short-term public repository for HWO-GOMAP WG/SG activities. GOMAP-HWO WG/SG meetings are posted to the [HWO-GOMAP Public Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y19jZTRjNzA4ZmFkNjYyYWJhMGM4ZWVmODRjZTI2MDZlNDRkNGY0NmE4MzczYWUzMTczOWZjMjhkZTNjZTljMWIxQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20) along with connection information for open meetings. WG/SG meeting agendas and notes are posted to the wikis associated with the public GitHub repositories for each WG/SG.
